## Topics
```
WEEK 1: CONCURRENCY - NUTS AND BOLTS

Processes and messages
In this activity we introduce the fundamentals of the Erlang concurrency model: message passing between processes that share nothing.
[x] 1.1 WELCOME VIDEO (01:11)
[x] 1.2 MESSAGE-PASSING CONCURRENCY VIDEO (10:02)
[x] 1.3 PROCESSES AND MESSAGES VIDEO (08:31)
[x] 1.4 PROCESSES AND MESSAGES IN PRACTICE VIDEO (12:35)
[x] 1.5 TRYING IT FOR YOURSELF ARTICLE
[x] 1.6 FROM SEQUENTIAL TO CONCURRENT VIDEO (10:44)

Processing the mailbox
In this activity we look to gain an appreciation of the mechanism underlying message processing in Erlang.
[x] 1.7 THE MAILBOX IN ERLANG VIDEO (08:04)
[x] 1.8 WORKING WITH THE MAILBOX ARTICLE
[x] 1.9 TIMING AND MESSAGE ORDERING VIDEO (09:31)
[x] 1.10 MESSAGES, MAILBOXES AND TIMING QUIZ
[x] 1.11 ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATION: PIDS AND NAMED PROCESSES VIDEO (06:58)

The frequency server
In this activity we introduce a larger scale example, the *frequency server*, as a case study.
[x] 1.12 INTRODUCING THE FREQUENCY SERVER VIDEO (12:31)
[x] 1.13 MODIFYING THE FREQUENCY SERVER ARTICLE
[x] 1.14 REFACTORING THE FREQUENCY SERVER VIDEO (04:47)
[x] 1.15 ENHANCING THE FREQUENCY SERVER ASSIGNMENT
[x] 1.16 ENHANCING THE FREQUENCY SERVER - REVIEW REVIEW
[x] 1.17 ENHANCING THE FREQUENCY SERVER - REFLECTION REFLECTION
[x] 1.18 ERLANG CONCURRENCY SO FAR DISCUSSION

Pulling it all together
In this week's final activity, we 'pull it all together' with a further two presentations from Joe Armstrong, and some concluding comments from Simon.
[x] 1.19 ABSTRACTING PATTERNS OF CONCURRENCY VIDEO (06:26)
[x] 1.20 CLIENT-SERVER VIDEO (07:14)
[x] 1.21 WEEK 1 SUMMARY ARTICLE

WEEK 2: CONCURRENCY - MAKING CODE ROBUST

The life cycle of processes
In this activity we consider the life cycle of processes in Erlang, looking to understand the different ways that an Erlang process can perform when it is executed.
[x] 2.1 WELCOME TO WEEK 2 VIDEO (01:49)
[x] 2.2 BUILDING ROBUST SYSTEMS VIDEO (04:24)
[x] 2.3 LET IT FAIL! VIDEO (08:02)
[x] 2.4 HANDLING ERRORS VIDEO (11:18)
[x] 2.5 LINKS, SIGNALS AND MESSAGES VIDEO (10:39)

Designing for robustness
In this activity we think about designing for robustness. We'll present a 'hardened' version of the frequency server introduced in the first week, as an application of process linking, and introduce the idea of supervisors.
[x] 2.6 HARDENING THE FREQUENCY SERVER VIDEO (07:37)
[x] 2.7 HARDENING THE FREQUENCY SERVER - TRYING IT FOR YOURSELF ARTICLE

[x] 2.13 TRYING SUPERVISION FOR YOURSELF DISCUSSION
[x] 2.14 CONCURRENCY AND ROBUSTNESS VIDEO (09:37)

Dealing with exceptions
In this activity we look at mechanisms to deal with exceptions - handling errors without failing - and apply this to our frequency server example.
[x] 2.15 EXCEPTIONS: 'THROW' AND 'CATCH' VIDEO (08:23)
[~] 2.16 EXCEPTIONS IN THE FREQUENCY SERVER ARTICLE
[x] 2.17 TRYING IT FOR YOURSELF DISCUSSION
